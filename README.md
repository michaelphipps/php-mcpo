# php-mcpo

This project is designed to make any MCP tool available as an OpenAPI-compatible HTTP server-instantly.

mcpo is a dead-simple proxy that takes an MCP server command and makes it accessible via standard RESTful OpenAPI, so your tools "just work" with LLM agents and apps expecting OpenAPI servers.

No custom protocol. No glue code. No hassle.
